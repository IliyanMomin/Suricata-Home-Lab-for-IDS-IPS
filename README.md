# Suricata-Home-Lab-for-IDS-IPS

## Objective

This project aims to set up and configure a home lab for Suricata, an open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), to enhance network security monitoring and threat detection capabilities. By deploying Suricata on an Ubuntu server, the project will explore its signature-based detection, anomaly detection, and multi-threading capabilities to identify and analyze suspicious network activity. The ultimate goal is to gain hands-on experience with network security monitoring, incident response, and threat hunting while optimizing detection rules and minimizing false positives.

### Skills Learned

- Network Security & Threat Detection – Configured Suricata IDS/IPS to monitor and identify suspicious network activity.
- Linux System Administration – Installed, managed, and troubleshot Suricata on an Ubuntu server.
- Network Traffic Analysis & Threat Hunting – Used Nmap and log monitoring to analyze traffic and fine-tune detection rules.
- Cybersecurity Implementation & Incident Response – Customized Suricata rules and analyzed alerts to detect and mitigate threats.

## Steps

Let's now install Suricata onto our Ubuntu Server.
